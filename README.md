A placeholder site for a friend built in gatsby using a ported HTML 5 template.

Based on [gatsby-starter-special](https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-spectral) by Abhunav Srivastava, a port of [spectral](https://html5up.net/spectral) by [HTML5up](https://html5up.net), under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.

### Code
For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

`index.js` layout sections have been ripped out for the sake of placeholder state. 

`//todo` Fix the height of the main background image to use the whole viewport.
